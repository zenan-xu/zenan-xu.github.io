## Collections / Map

### ArrayList vs LinkedList
1. Internal Implementation
    * ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements.
    * LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
2. Manipulation
    * ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower.
    * LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
3. Implementation
    * ArrayList implements only List. 
    * LinkedList implements List as well as Queue. It can acts as a queue as well.
4. Access
    * ArrayList is faster in storing and accessing data.
    * LinkedList is faster in manipulation of data.
